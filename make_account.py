## Task 2 —Bank acount with nested functions

# Write a function:

# make_account(initial_balance)


# that creates and returns two functions representing operations on a bank account:

# - a function for depositing money,

# - a function for withdrawing money.

# The account balance must be initialized using initial_balance and must persist betwen function calls.

# The following rules apply;

# - Deposits and withdrawals must use positive numeric values.

# - The account balance must never become negative.

# - Invalid operations must raise appropriate Python exceptions.

# - The account balance must not be directly accessible from outside the returned functions.
